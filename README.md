Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€” Key Points
1.Understand the Dataset
Overview of dataset size (rows, columns)
Description of features (numerical, categorical, target variable)

2.Summary Statistics
Mean, median, mode, standard deviation for numerical features
Distribution of categorical variables (value counts)

3.Missing Data Analysis
Identify missing values per column
Percentage of missing data
Plan for handling missing data (imputation, removal)

4.Common Seaborn Plots for EDA

Pairplot
Shows pairwise relationships between numerical features.

Relplot
Flexible function for scatter plots and line plots.
Good for showing relationships between two variables.

Distplot (deprecated in latest seaborn versions; use histplot or displot)
Shows distribution of a numerical variable.

Catplot
Combines several categorical plots (box, violin, bar, strip, swarm).
Great for comparing distributions across categories

5.Feature Relationships
Correlation matrix to check linear relationships
Scatter plots or pair plots for feature interactions

6.Feature Engineering Insights
Identify features needing transformation or encoding
Detect potential new features based on data patterns
