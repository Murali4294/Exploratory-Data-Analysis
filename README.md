Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€” Key Points
1.Understand the Dataset
Overview of dataset size (rows, columns)
Description of features (numerical, categorical, target variable)

2.Summary Statistics
Mean, median, mode, standard deviation for numerical features
Distribution of categorical variables (value counts)

3.Missing Data Analysis
Identify missing values per column
Percentage of missing data
Plan for handling missing data (imputation, removal)

4.Data Visualization
Histograms, boxplots for numerical feature distributions
Bar charts, count plots for categorical features
Heatmap of feature correlations

5.Feature Relationships
Correlation matrix to check linear relationships
Scatter plots or pair plots for feature interactions

6.Feature Engineering Insights
Identify features needing transformation or encoding
Detect potential new features based on data patterns
